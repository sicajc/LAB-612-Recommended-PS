# LAB612 Hardware Tranining problem Sets
1. Every hardware you design must has its datapath drawn and with detailed description about how you do it.<br />
2. You have to give a report about your hardware design and verification process all the way from algorithm to synthesis.<br />
3. You have to write your own testbenches for your own circuit<br />
4. The code you created must be synthesizable<br />
5. DATAPATH AND CONTROLPATH HAS TO BE PROVIDED <br />
6. You must provide your system diagram <br />
